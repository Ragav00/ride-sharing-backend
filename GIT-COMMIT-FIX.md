# 🔧 Git Commit Message Fix

## Problem: `dquote>` in Terminal

When you see `dquote>` prompt, it means the terminal is waiting for a closing quote.

### **Quick Fix:**
```bash
# If stuck in dquote> prompt:
# Press: Ctrl+C (to cancel)
# Then retry with simple message
```

### **Safe Commit Messages:**

✅ **Good (Single line, simple quotes):**
```bash
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment issues"
git commit -m "Add MongoDB connection"
git commit -m "Update documentation"
```

❌ **Avoid (Complex messages with special characters):**
```bash
git commit -m "🔧 Railway deployment compatibility fixes

✅ Fixes Applied:
- Remove mongodb-memory-server"
```

### **Railway Status Check:**

Your Railway deployment should now work with these fixes:
- ✅ Removed mongodb-memory-server 
- ✅ Simplified database connection
- ✅ Added Railway-specific Redis config

### **Next Steps:**
1. Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
2. Ensure Redis service is added
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Test the deployment URL

**Your Railway deployment should be working now! 🚀**
